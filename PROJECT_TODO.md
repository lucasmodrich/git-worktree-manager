## Findings & Issues

### High Priority Issues

1. **Typo in LICENCE file download (Line 241)**
   - Script downloads to "LICENCE" but standard is "LICENSE"
   - This could break expectations for users looking for license file

2. **Missing error handling for curl failures**
   - Lines 197, 233, 237-241: No check if curl commands succeed
   - Could lead to corrupt or missing files during upgrade

3. **Potential command injection vulnerability**
   - Line 344: `REPO_NAME=$(basename -s .git "$REPO_PATH")` uses unsanitized input
   - Lines 346-347: mkdir/cd with unsanitized `$REPO_NAME`

4. **No validation of GitHub repo format**
   - Script accepts any input as org/repo without validation
   - Could lead to unexpected behavior with malformed inputs

### Medium Priority Issues

1. **Hardcoded installation directory**
   - `SCRIPT_FOLDER="$HOME/.git-worktree-manager"` is inflexible
   - Users might want to install elsewhere

2. **Silent curl failures in upgrade**
   - Using `curl -s` hides potential network errors
   - Should provide feedback on download progress/failures

3. **IFS not properly restored**
   - Lines 44-45, 72-73: IFS modified but not saved/restored
   - Could affect subsequent code if script is sourced

4. **Missing quotes in some variable expansions**
   - Potential word splitting issues in edge cases

5. **Commented debug line left in code**
   - Line 234: Commented mv command suggests incomplete refactoring

### Low Priority Issues / Improvements

1. **Inconsistent error exit codes**
   - Sometimes exit 1, sometimes exit 0 on errors
   - Should standardize error codes

2. **Mixed string comparison styles**
   - Uses both `==` and `=` for string comparison
   - Should be consistent (prefer `=` for POSIX compatibility)

3. **version_gt function complexity**
   - 100+ lines for version comparison
   - Consider using existing tools or simplifying

4. **No shellcheck directive**
   - Adding shellcheck directives would help maintain quality

5. **Limited test coverage**
   - Only version comparison is tested
   - Need tests for core functionality

### Questions for Discussion

1. **Why is the installation directory hardcoded?**
   - Should we make it configurable via environment variable?

2. **Should we add a --dry-run option?**
   - Would help users preview actions before execution

3. **Remote branch deletion on --remove?**
   - Currently only deletes local branch
   - Should we offer option to delete remote too?

4. **Dependency on bash-specific features**
   - Script uses arrays and bash-specific syntax
   - Is POSIX sh compatibility desired?

5. **Error recovery strategy**
   - Should script attempt to rollback on failures?

## Proposed Improvements

### Short-term (Quick Wins)
1. Fix LICENCE typo ‚Üí LICENSE
2. Add error checking for curl commands
3. Remove commented code (line 234)
4. Add input validation for repo format
5. Add shellcheck directives
6. Standardize exit codes (1 for errors, 0 for success)
7. Fix IFS save/restore pattern

### Medium-term
1. Make installation directory configurable
2. Add --dry-run option for preview mode
3. Improve error messages with actionable feedback
4. Add progress indicators for long operations
5. Create comprehensive test suite
6. Add GitHub Actions for testing PRs
7. Implement proper logging mechanism

### Long-term
1. Consider modularizing the script into functions
2. Add support for other Git hosting platforms
3. Implement configuration file support
4. Add interactive mode for guided setup
5. Consider rewriting critical sections for POSIX compatibility
6. Add command completion support

### Semantic Release Analysis & Options

**Current Setup (What's Working Well):**
1. ‚úÖ Conventional commit analysis working
2. ‚úÖ Automatic VERSION file creation
3. ‚úÖ Script version updating in source code
4. ‚úÖ GitHub releases with assets
5. ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md generation
6. ‚úÖ Two-branch strategy (main + dev/beta)

**Potential Areas for Discussion:**

1. **Commit Types & Version Bumping:**
   - Current: Uses default semantic-release rules
   - Options:
     - Add custom rules for script-specific changes
     - Define what constitutes breaking changes for a CLI tool
     - Consider patch vs minor for new features like --dry-run

2. **Release Assets Strategy:**
   - Current: Individual files + tarball
   - Options:
     - Single executable release
     - Checksums for verification
     - Multiple platform packages (if needed)

3. **Branch Strategy:**
   - Current: main (stable) + dev (beta prereleases)
   - Options:
     - Add hotfix branch support
     - Release candidate workflow
     - Keep current simple approach

4. **Version Management:**
   - Current: Updates script source directly
   - Options:
     - External version file only
     - Git tags as source of truth
     - Current approach (embedded version)

5. **Release Notes Enhancement:**
   - Current: Auto-generated from commits
   - Options:
     - Custom release note templates
     - Migration guides for breaking changes
     - Installation instructions in releases

**My Recommendation:**
The current setup is solid for a shell script project! Main considerations:
- Should we be more specific about what constitutes breaking changes?
- Would checksums add value for security-conscious users?
- Is the current two-branch strategy meeting your needs?
